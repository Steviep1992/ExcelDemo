# ExcelDemo
Excel sheet that I have made macros / buttons in that have different functions 

All functions were made from either recording a macro, or adding VBA code. The functions range from inputting data from a text file into the csv file, all the way to clicking a button and the cell displaying the current date and time. Some are saved as macros, and some I made into a button as well. This was a self teaching lesson for myself to learn VBA and different macros, more will be coming while I expand the project.
